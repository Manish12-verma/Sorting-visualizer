# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Introduction

Sorting algorithms are crucial for efficient data organization and retrieval in computer science. Understanding these algorithms can be challenging, but visualizing their operation provides valuable insights into their mechanics. This project aims to enhance learning by providing an interactive web application that visually represents various sorting algorithms.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to create a web application that allows users to visualize the process of different sorting algorithms in real-time. Users will be able to observe how elements are swapped and rearranged to achieve a sorted array, making it easier to grasp the workings of these algorithms.

## Project Overview

### Purpose

The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer provides an intuitive platform for observing and understanding sorting algorithms. By visualizing the sorting process, users will:

- Gain a clearer understanding of how different sorting algorithms operate.
- Observe the efficiency and performance of various algorithms.
- Appreciate the real-world applicability of these techniques.

### Features

- **Interactive Visualization:** Users can select from multiple sorting algorithms and watch the array elements being sorted. The visualization dynamically updates to show the current state of the array, with elements highlighted as they are compared or swapped.

- **Algorithm Selection:** Supports several popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort. Additional algorithms can be added in the future.

- **Responsive Design:** The visualizations are designed to be compatible with various devices, ensuring an optimal learning experience on both desktop and mobile platforms.

- **Customizable Parameters:** Users can generate arrays of different sizes and values to explore how the algorithms handle varying datasets.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For structuring the web page and defining the layout of the visualization elements.
- **CSS:** For styling the visualization and creating a visually appealing user interface.
- **JavaScript:** For implementing the sorting algorithms, handling user interactions, and dynamically updating the visualization.
